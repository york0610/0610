/**
 * Surfaces is an enum containing the unique names of each surface (location in the Netlify UI) that a
 * UI extension can render to.
 *
 * The SDK exposes which surface your extension UI app is currently rendering to, so you can use this enum for
 * routing and display the correct UI for a given surface to a user.
 *
 * Documentation:
 * - [Add a new surface to extension UI](https://developers.netlify.com/sdk/extension-ui/add-a-new-surface/)
 * - [Reference docs](https://developers.netlify.com/sdk/api/netlify/sdk/ui/react/enumerations/surfaces/)
